### Draw Google maps polygons and get coordinates as JSON

Use it: https://fabran99.github.io/Polygon-to-coordinates/build/index.html

App uses ReactJS and is inspired by this codepen https://codepen.io/jhawes/pen/ujdgK
I added some functionalities, like add multiple polygons, undo, download as json, set the color, etc.

## Simple guide

Just draw the polygon, se the name and color and press Save button. That will add the polygon to the JSON.
Once you save one polygon, it will get fixed to its current form, so you have to press edit below if you want to make any changes.
Whenever you save a polygon, another one appears in the center of the screen, this one is not added to the JSON if you donÂ´t save it. Probably in next versions I will add and Add polygon functionality instead of doing it automaticaly when the user saves.

Pressing CTRL + Z undo the last change.
Reset polygon button sets the polygon to a rectangle in the center of the screen.

## Load JSON

You can load a JSON in the same format as the generated by the app, so you can edit polygons or add new ones to the file.
